# .env.json

From the settings explored on the last step, capture them in a file as follows:

## .env.json

~~~
{
  "cloudinary": {
    "cloud_name": "YOURID",
    "api_key": "YOURKEY",
    "api_secret": "YOURSECRET"
  }
}
~~~

Keep this file safe, and dont share it with anyone. Also, do not put it on github or any public repository.
