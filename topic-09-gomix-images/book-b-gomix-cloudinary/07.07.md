# Deleting Photos

Finally, we can bring in controls to delete images, either individually for in bulk. First the new routes:

## routes.js

~~~
...
router.get('/dashboard/deleteallpictures', dashboard.deleteAllPictures);
router.get('/dashboard/deletepicture', dashboard.deletePicture);
...
~~~

This is the implementation of the Dasboard delete actions:

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~
...
  deleteAllPictures(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    pictureStore.deleteAllPictures(loggedInUser.id);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },

  deletePicture(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    pictureStore.deletePicture(loggedInUser.id, request.query.img);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
...  
~~~

# Delete All

Plant this button somewhere in the dashboard view:

## views/dashboard.hbs

~~~
...
  <div class="ui segment">
    <a href="/dashboard/deleteallpictures"> <button class="negative ui button">Delete All</button></a>
  </div>
...

~~~

Run the app now, locate and press the `Delete All` button. It should remove all pictures for the logged in user. When you try it, check the Cloudinary web interface to see if the images are actually removed.

# Delete a single picture

To delete a single picture, we need this routes:

.. and a new version of the card which will include a delete (trash can) button:

## views/partials/card.hbs

~~~
<div class="ui card">
  <div class="ui small center aligned image">
    <img src="{{img}}">
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="center aligned header">{{title}}</p>
    <div class="center aligned meta">
      <a href="/dashboard/deletepicture?img={{img}}">
        <i class="red icon trash"></i>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
~~~


See if you can delete individual pictures now.
