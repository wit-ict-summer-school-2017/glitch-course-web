# Setup

In Gomix,  create a new project and then import this to replace the default content:

- <https://github.com/wit-ict-summer-school-2017/glitch-template-2>

You do this be going to the advanced menu, select Import from Github and enter `wit-ict-summer-school-2017/glitch-template-2`

Explore the UX. It is a variant on the template we have been already using, except this one has user accounts built in. 

There are already 2 accounts pre-loaded (Homer and Marge). Try these out - and also try registering a new user.

Review the source - it should be familiar from earlier labs.
