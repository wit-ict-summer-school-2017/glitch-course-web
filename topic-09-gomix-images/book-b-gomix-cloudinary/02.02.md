# Express Libraries

## package.json

We need to add some modules to our application to support image upload and the cloudinary API. These are included in the `package.json` file like this:

~~~
...
    "cloudinary": "^1.9.0",
...
~~~

Here is how the package.json dependencies section should look now:

~~~
...
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.17.1",
    "cloudinary": "^1.9.0",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.3",
    "express": "^4.15.2npm",
    "express-fileupload": "^0.1.3",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.0",
    "fs-extra": "^3.0.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.4",
    "lowdb": "^0.16.2",
    "uuid": "^3.0.1",
    "winston": "^2.3.1"
  },
...  
~~~


When editing the package.json file in Glitch, make sure to keep the logs open - so you can see if there are any typos/errors immediately.

If you are working fully off line, on your own workstations, then the following commands - entered from within the project folder - will update package.json for you automatically:

~~~
npm install cloudinary --save
~~~


Make sure the app starts without any errors and functions as expected.
