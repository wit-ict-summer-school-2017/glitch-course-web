# Picture Routes

We can bring in this new route now:

## routes.js
~~~
...
router.post('/dashboard/uploadpicture', dashboard.uploadPicture);
...
~~~

Here is a new version of the dashboard.js module:

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~
'use strict';

const logger = require('../utils/logger');
const accounts = require('./accounts.js');
const pictureStore = require('../models/picture-store.js');

const dashboard = {
  index(request, response) {
    logger.info('dashboard rendering');
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    const viewData = {
      title: 'PictureStore Dashboard',
      user: loggedInUser,
      album: pictureStore.getAlbum(loggedInUser.id),
    };
    response.render('dashboard', viewData);
  },

  uploadPicture(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    pictureStore.addPicture(loggedInUser.id, request.body.title, request.files.picture, function () {
      response.redirect('/dashboard');
    });
  },
};

module.exports = dashboard;
~~~

Try this now, and upload a picture - pick a small image from somewhere on your local machine. It will not display yet - but it should upload successfully.

Because of the lag in how gomix works, it may take a little while for `picture-store.json` to refresh. When it eventually does, it may look something like this:

## models/picture-store.json

~~~
{
  "pictures": [
    {
      "userid": "3ad52697-6d98-4d80-8273-084de55a86c0",
      "photos": [
        {
          "img": "http://res.cloudinary.com/edel020/image/upload/v1490458845/ncmyd6i1brylui1senk9.png",
          "title": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Log in to your cloudinary account and see if the image is in your Media Library. Also, see if the image url corresponds with the "img" url in your picture-store.json file (if you can load it).

Our pictures will not appear on our dashboard yet however (next steps).
