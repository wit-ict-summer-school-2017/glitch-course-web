# Solution

This is the completed application:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/gomix-pictures>

If you are in Gomix - import the project from github: `edeleastar/gomix-pictures` 

# Exercise 1: Download and run Locally

Download the project and run it on our own workstation. Remember, after downloading you must run:

~~~
npm install
~~~

from inside the project folder, and then run:

~~~
npm start
~~~

to run. Browse to

- <http://localhost:4000/>

to see it in action. Experiment with uploading some pictures, and keep an eye on the contents of the `models/pictures` folder. This should give you a better idea as to how the app is working.

## Exercise 2: (Advanced)

Ultimately, managing photos is best outsourced to a specialist service. Here is one example:

- <http://cloudinary.com/>

The free account here would be fine:

- <http://cloudinary.com/pricing>

The documentation here show how to program the service from node:

- <http://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration>

The examples they discuss are all on github:

- <https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/tree/master/samples>

Could you replace/reimplement the picture-store module we have implemented with one that uses this service instead?
