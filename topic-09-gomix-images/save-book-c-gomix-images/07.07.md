# Deleting Photos

Gomix does not let you see the `picture` folder - although when you download the project, it will contain pictures you will have uploaded.

In order to help with Gomix development, we need some way of cleaning out the picture store, deleting all images. We already have support for this in the picture-store module. We can introduce new buttons into the UX to trigger delete.

# Delete All

Delete all photos is easy. First bring in this route:

## routes.js

~~~
...
router.get('/dashboard/deleteallpictures', dashboard.deleteAllPictures);
...
~~~

... and this action in the dashboard module

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~
...
  deleteAllPictures(request, response) {
    pictureStore.deleteAllPicturea();
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
...
~~~

Finally, we can plant this button somewhere in the dashboard view:

## views/dashboard.hbs

~~~
...
      <a href="/dashboard/deleteallpictures"> <button class="negative ui button">Delete All</button></a>
...

~~~

Run the app now, locate and press the `Delete All` button. It should remove all pictures from the app, and also delete all of the actual images (hidden) in your project.


# Delete a single picture

To delete a single picture, we need this routes:


## routes.js

~~~
...
router.get('/dashboard/deletepicture/:path/:name', dashboard.deletePicture);
...
~~~

this action in the dashboard module

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~
  deletePicture(request, response) {
    pictureStore.deletePicture(request.params.path, request.params.name);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
~~~

.. and a new version of the card which will include a delete (trash can) button:

## views/partials/card.hbs

~~~
<div class="ui card">
  <div class="ui small center aligned image">
    <img src="/dashboard/getpicture{{img}}">
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="center aligned header">{{title}}</p>
    <div class="center aligned meta">
      {{file}}
      <a href="/dashboard/deletepicture{{img}}">
        <i class="red icon trash"></i>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
~~~


See if you can delete individual pictures now.
