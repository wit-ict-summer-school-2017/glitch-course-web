# Template 1

Create a new project in Glitch - this will be a replica of the project created at the start of the last lab. Rename the project to your preference.

Turn on the logs viewer now.

From the Advanced options, Select `import a project from github`. (You may need to grant access to your github account before this option becomes available).
