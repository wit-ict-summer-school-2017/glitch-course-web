# Dynamic Playlist

The app as we have it now could have been completely built as a static web site. However, the framework and tools we have used in this version enable us to evolve this static site into an interactive web app.

The first step is to eliminate some of the static content from the listsongs partial. Here is a new version to replace the current version (in listsongs.hbs replace the table with the following):

~~~html
<table class="ui table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {{#each playlist.songs}}
      <tr>
        <td>
          {{title}}
        </td>
        <td>
          {{artist}}
        </td>
      </tr>
    {{/each}}
  </tbody>
</table>
~~~

In the above, we are `iterating` over an `array` of `songs` inside a `playlist` object:

~~~html
{{#each playlist.songs}}
  <tr>
    <td>
      {{title}}
    </td>
    <td>
      {{artist}}
    </td>
  </tr>
{{/each}}
~~~

This playlist object must be passed to the view for this to work.

In the `dashboard.js` controller, we can define a playlist object in Javascript (place this definition prior to the dashboard object definition):

~~~js
const sonatas = {
  title: 'Sonatas',
  songs: [
    {
      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 3',
      artist: 'Beethoven',
    },
    {
      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 7',
      artist: 'Beethoven',
    },
    {
      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10',
      artist: 'Beethoven',
    },
  ],
};
~~~

Examine the above structure carefully. This is a javascript `object literal`. It consists of :

- a title field containing the string `Sonatas`
- an array called `songs`, which contains 3 objects, each of which has:
    - title
    - artist

The index method which is located in  dashboard.js file can now be modified to pass this list to the view:

~~~js
const dashboard = {
index(request, response) {
  logger.info('dashboard rendering');
  const viewData = {
    title: 'Playlist Dashboard',
    playlist: sonatas,
  };
  response.render('dashboard', viewData);
},
};
~~~

This should work now as expected. Make sure the playlist is displayed as expected.

We can take advantage of the logger to display the playlist before we render it:

~~~js
index(request, response) {
  logger.info('dashboard rendering');
  const viewData = {
    title: 'Playlist Dashboard',
    playlist: sonatas,
  };
  logger.info('about to render', sonatas);
  response.render('dashboard', viewData);
},
~~~

You should see something like this in the logs:

## Logs

We can change the format of the logs to better reflect the underlying data structure. Locate this line in `utils/logger.js`:

~~~
  transports: [new (winston.transports.Console)({ json: false })],
~~~

We dont need to understand the details - but we can change `false` to `true`:

~~~
  transports: [new (winston.transports.Console)({ json: true })],
~~~

This will change how the playlists are displayed in the logs:
