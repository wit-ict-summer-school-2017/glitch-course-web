# Dashboard

Try the following now:

- Log in as 'homer@simpson', 'secret'. 
- Add a playlist called 'test'.
- logout
- Log in as 'marge@simpson', 'secret'. 

Notice that we are seeing Homers test playlist even when we log in as marge? The playlist-store.json may look like this:

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
    {
      "id": "4a1ea4ec-303e-4b13-bd98-a6b04877e093",
      "title": "test",
      "songs": []
    }
  ]
}
~~~

(you will need to refresh the Glitch Editor view to see the above change)

This clearly is not what we were aiming for. We should only present the users own play lists.

Here is how do it - all changes to the dashboard module:

## controller/dashboard.js

In the top of the module, import the new accounts module:

~~~
...
const accounts = require ('./accounts.js');
...
~~~

Revised index action:

~~~
...
  index(request, response) {
    logger.info('dashboard rendering');
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    const viewData = {
      title: 'Playlist Dashboard',
      playlists: playlistStore.getUserPlaylists(loggedInUser.id),
    };
    logger.info('about to render', playlistStore.getAllPlaylists());
    response.render('dashboard', viewData);
  },
...
~~~

Revised addPlaylist action:

~~~
...
  addPlaylist(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    const newPlayList = {
      id: uuid(),
      userid: loggedInUser.id,
      title: request.body.title,
      songs: [],
    };
    logger.debug('Creating a new Playlist', newPlayList);
    playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
...
~~~

Log in again as marge and homer in turn, creating a single playlist (use a name you will remember). Make sure that the appropriate playlist appears in each users dashboard.


## The Stores

Looking at the playlist-store.json - it might (eventually when loaded) look like this:

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
    {
      "id": "4a1ea4ec-303e-4b13-bd98-a6b04877e093",
      "title": "test",
      "songs": []
    },
    {
      "id": "1e6ed5a0-28fe-4527-8ce8-6cb5c800b5be",
      "userid": "2b6f0989-7b7f-4a38-ad26-aa06b922d751",
      "title": "marges playlist",
      "songs": []
    },
    {
      "id": "07dd66fe-9f8f-456c-944d-48330bde4610",
      "userid": "3ad52697-6d98-4d80-8273-084de55a86c0",
      "title": "homers playlist",
      "songs": []
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Examine it carefully - notice that the very first playlist is 'orphaned' - it has no userid. The others have userid - which corellates the playlists with the user in the users store:

~~~
{
  "users": [
    {
      "firstName": "homer",
      "lastName": "simpson",
      "email": "homer@simpson.com",
      "password": "secret",
      "id": "3ad52697-6d98-4d80-8273-084de55a86c0"
    },
    {
      "firstName": "marge",
      "lastName": "simpson",
      "email": "marge@simpson.com",
      "password": "secret",
      "id": "2b6f0989-7b7f-4a38-ad26-aa06b922d751"
    }
  ]
}
~~~
