# Playlist Model

This lab is based on Playlist-3. This can be imported into a new gomix project from `/wit-ict-summer-school-2017/playlist-3`.

## models/playlist-store.js

If your project has any playlists in the json store, delete them now. Your store should look like this:

## models/playlist-store.json

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
  ]
}
~~~


We need a new method in the playlist-store module, which will retrieve a playlist based on a specific user id.

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~
...
  getUserPlaylists(userid) {
    return this.store.findBy(this.collection, { userid: userid });
  },
...
~~~

This new methods takes a userid, and will only fetch playlists belonging to the user with the specific id. We havent introduced the User model yet - nor are we storing playlists with such an id. We will make these changes in this lab.
