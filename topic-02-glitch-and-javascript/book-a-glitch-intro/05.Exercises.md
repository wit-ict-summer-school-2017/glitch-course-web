include these extra elements in the `<head>` section of index:

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.6/semantic.min.css" type="text/css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.6/semantic.min.js"></script>
~~~

Try to modify index.html to render as above using semantic ui `container`, `segment`, `header` and `form` classes.

## Exercise 2:

- locate and upload an image by dragging it to the `assets` folder.
- click on the image to acquire the image `url`
- insert an `<img>` tag with this url into index.

## Exercise 3:

If you completed the above tasks, download the the app again and run it locally (see step 4).
