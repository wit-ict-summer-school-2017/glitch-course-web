# Exercise Solutions

This lab requires that the `gomix-playlist-2` lab be completed. If you have lost your solution, create a new project in Gomix and select the `import from github` option and enter `edeleastar/gomix-playlist-2` to import a completed version.

## Exercise 1: UX Enhancements & Exercise 3: listplaylists partial

Introduce a 'Delete Playlist' button for each playlist, represented by a `trash` icon.

## views/dashboard.hbs

~~~html
{{> menu id="dashboard"}}

<section class="ui segment">
  {{> listplaylists}}
</section>
~~~

## views/partials/listplaylists.hbs

~~~html
{{#each playlists}}
  <section class="ui stacked segment">
    <h2 class="ui header">
      {{title}}
    </h2>
    <p> Total Duration: {{duration}} </p>
    <a href="/playlist/{{id}}" class="ui icon button">
      <i class="icon folder open"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="/dashboard/deleteplaylist/{{id}}" class="ui icon button">
      <i class="icon trash"></i>
    </a>
  </section>
{{/each}}
~~~

## Exercise 2: Delete Playlist Functionality

Make the button actually delete the denoted playlist.

## routes.js

~~~js
...
router.get('/dashboard/deleteplaylist/:id', dashboard.deletePlaylist);
...
~~~

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~js
...
  deletePlaylist(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    logger.debug(`Deleting Playlist ${playlistId}`);
    playlistStore.removePlaylist(playlistId);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
...
~~~

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~js
  removePlaylist(id) {
    _.remove(this.playlistCollection, { id: id });
  },
~~~
