#Exercises

See if you can deploy your assignment 1 project using surge.

Here are the steps:

# 1

Make sure you have the node+harp+surge packages installed on your computer.

#2

Create a new (empty) folder to contain your project. Into this folder place the following file:

##harp.json

~~~
{
  "globals": 
  {

  }
}
~~~

#3

Place your entire project into a folder called `public` inside this project folder (as we did in step 06).

#4

From the command line, enter the command:

~~~
harp server
~~~

#5 

Verify that your side it available on:

    - <http://localhost:9000/>

#6

Terminate the server with ^C, and then enter:

~~~
surge
~~~

This will deploy the web site:

~~~
  project path: G:\dev\iot-web\
               size: 34 files, 2.3 MB
             domain: XXX.surge.sh
             upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s
   propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%
               plan: Free
              users: youremail@domain.com
         IP address: 192.241.214.148

    Success! Project is published and running at XXX.surge.sh
~~~

#7
Verify that the site is available on the domain. You will have the opportunity to change the domain `XXX`

#8

Exchange project URLs with your friends!

#9 

You may have had relative paths in your html files:

~~~
  <a href="../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

or even more confusing:

~~~
  <a href="../../stuff/mupage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

These type of references can all be replaced with:

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

~~~
  <a href="/stuff/mypage.html"> my stuff </a>
~~~

Try this now - one link at a time to make sure it works.
