# Installing & Using Harp.js

First, install node on your workstation:

- <https://nodejs.org/en/>

Then install install harp.js

- <http://harpjs.com/>

The procedure for both of the above should be relatively straightforward. For windows, the harp install command is:

~~~
npm install -g harp
~~~

On Mac, the command may be:

~~~
sudo npm install -g harp
~~~

Once these tools are installed, then from a shell/Command prompt, you should be able to carry out these commands :

~~~
harp init demo
~~~

This will respond with: 

~~~
Downloading boilerplate: https://github.com/harp-boilerplates/default

~~~

Then enter:

~~~
cd demo
harp server
~~~

Which will respond with: 

~~~

Now browse to this url here:

- <http://localhost:9000>

and you should see this page:
