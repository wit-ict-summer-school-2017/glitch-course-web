This is already configured to work with the harp server. Open a shell in the `navdemo` folder and run the server:

~~~
harp server
------------
Harp v0.23.0 – Chloi Inc. 2012–2015
Your server is listening at http://localhost:9000/
Press Ctl+C to stop the server
------------
~~~

Browse to <http://localhost:9000/> ... the site should be available.

Because we are running the site under an EJS server, we can start to EJS features.
