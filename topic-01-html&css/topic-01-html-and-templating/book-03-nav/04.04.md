# Navigation

We can now try the same with the navigation section:

## includes/nav.ejs

~~~
<nav id="navigation">
  <ul id="menu">
    <li class="current"><a href="index.html">Mauris</a></li>
    <li><a href="page1.html"> Cras </a></li>
    <li><a href="page2.html">Proin</a></li>
    <li><a href="page3.html">Integer</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
~~~

Replace the nav section in each file with this:

~~~

<%- partial("includes/_nav.ejs") %>

~~~

Browse to <http://localhost:9000/> to make sure it is serving correctly.

However, there will be a problem: not matter which page we visit, the first navigation entry remains highlighted.

This is because the <nav> is now shared - it always marks the first element as `active`:

~~~
...
    <li class="current"><a href="index.html">Mauris</a></li>
...
~~~

One solution would be to reverse the last change - and keep the `<nav>` section individual to each page. An alternative is implemented in the next step....
