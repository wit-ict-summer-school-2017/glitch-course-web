#Includes

Create a new folder in your project called `includes` and create the following files:

##_header.ejs

~~~
<header id="header">
  <h2>
    <img class="header-crest-img" src="assets/images/wit-crest.png" alt="WIT Crest">
    Department of Computing &amp; Mathematics
  </h2>
  <h3> BSc (Hons) the Internet of Things </h3>
  <hr>
</header>
~~~

##_footer.ejs

~~~
<footer id="footer">
  <hr>
  <p class="footer-social-links">
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com/witcomp"> facebook </a>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/ComputingAtWIT"> twitter </a>
    <a href="https://ie.linkedin.com/pub/computing-at-wit/a9/221/1b6"> linkedin </a>
  </p>
</footer>
~~~

Notice that these are fragments, not complete pages - and are more or less the same for all pages in our site. Also notice that these particular file names are prefixed with '_' (underscore).

Now rename the file `index.html` to call it `index.ejs`.

The project folder should now be structured as follows:

~~~
iot-web-ejs
├── harp.json
└── public
    ├── assets
    │     ...
    ├── includes
    │   ├── _header.ejs
    │   └── _footer.ejs 
    ├── index.ejs
    ├── strands
    │   ├── data.html
    │   ├── devices.html
    │   ├── maths.html
    │   ├── networks.html
    │   ├── programming.html
    │   └── project.html
    └── style.css
~~~

Files with the extension `ejs` we call templates - they contain `HTML` markup as before but also additional notations we will explore shortly.

##index.ejs

We can now make one very significant change to `index.ejs` - we can completely remove the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements - replacing them with the following `partial` statements:

~~~
...
<%- partial("includes/_header.ejs") %>

...

<%- partial("includes/_footer.ejs") %>
...
~~~

Assuming you are still `serving` the page, visit it now:

- <http://localhost:9000/>

There should be `no change` in how the page is rendered. Our index page is now generated by its own content + the `partials` including at the head and foot of the pages.

You may also wish to try to open the page directly from the folder/file. Try this now as well. You may need to drag/drop index.ejs to an open browser, as the file type is not longer recognized.

You will notice that it does not render correctly - the `partial` statements appear to not be processed correctly:

From now on, we can only view the pages via the 'harp server' command - and the pages will be in fragments that this program assembles for us.
