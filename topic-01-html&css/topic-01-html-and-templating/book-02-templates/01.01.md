#Setup

Continue on with the project form the last lab, or download this archive if you want to start from scratch:

- <https://github.com/wit-ictskills-2016/iot-web/tree/V08>

... and expand it to suitable location on your hard drive. It will be structured like this:

~~~
iot-web-ejs
├── harp.json
└── public
    ├── assets
    │   └── images
    │       ├── automotive.png
    │       ├── banner.jpg
    │       ├── ctrg.png
    │       │ .... 
    │       ├── tssg.png
    │       └── wit-crest.png
    ├── index.html
    ├── strands
    │   ├── data.html
    │   ├── devices.html
    │   ├── maths.html
    │   ├── networks.html
    │   ├── programming.html
    │   └── project.html
    └── style.css
~~~

(Not all the image files shown)

Open the folder in Sublime - and make sure you reveal the folder structure as shown above.

We would now like to 'serve' the web site - using the tools we installed in the last lab. This will involve running a command prompt in the same folder as the directory containing the project, and entering the `harp server` command:

If you have the `node` archive expanded onto your G: drive (as described in the last lab) then this pattern should work:

Run the `Command Prompt` and then enter:

~~~
C:\My Documents> G:
G:\> cd iot-web-ejs
G:\iot-web-ejs> harp server
Your server is listening at http://localhost:9000/
Press Ctl+C to stop the server
~~~

Visit this page in your browser:

- <http://localhost:9000/>

and it should render as expected.

Also, open `index.html` in your browser by locating the file on disk - as you will be used to doing in the labs so far.

The site will render more or less exactly the same using both techniques. Verify this now - and note carefully the slight differences in the URL in the address bar in both cases.
