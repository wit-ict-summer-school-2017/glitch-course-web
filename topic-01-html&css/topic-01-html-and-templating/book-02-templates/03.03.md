#Data Strands

Locate the file `strands/data.html` and rename it to `strands/data.ejs`

Open this page in sublime - and delete the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements - replacing them with the `partial`s we already include in `index.ejs`:

~~~
...
<%- partial("../includes/_header.ejs") %>

...

<%- partial("../includes/_footer.ejs") %>
...
~~~

Notice the '..' prefixes the path because the data page is in a subdirectory.

Assuming you are still `serving` the site, visit it now:

- <http://localhost:9000/>

... and verify that the Data Science pages renders correctly.

You may notice that it almost works - the WIT Crest seems to appear ok in the index page, but in Data Science it seems to be missing.

We can fix this now - open `_header.ejs` and change the path to the crest:

~~~
    <img class="header-crest-img" src="/assets/images/wit-crest.png" alt="WIT Crest">
~~~

(we have just placed a `/` in front of the assets path name)

Check now that the crest appears correctly.
