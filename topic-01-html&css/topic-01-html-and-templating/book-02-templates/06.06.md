#Layout

This final step is a little more ambitious - involving the use of a `layout`. This is a reusable structure for an entire page, and can simplify and centralize the simplify the management and organisation of large sites. We will apply a layout to just the `strand` pages.

First, create a new file in the `strands` folder:

##_layout.ejs

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" />
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css" media="screen"/>
  <title> IoT Strands </title>
</head>
<body>

<%- partial("../includes/_header.ejs") %>
<%- yield %>
<%- partial("../includes/_footer.ejs") %>

</body>
</html>
~~~


This is a master layout for all strand pages. It contains a standard `<head>` section, and in the `<body>` we include the header and footer templates. However, notice that between these includes is the following statement:

~~~
<%- yield %>
~~~

This is a special directive, which will be replaced with the contents of any other pages in this folder.

Now, turning our attention to the strand pages themselves - we can remove completed the head and include sections of all the pages. This is a new version of `programming.ejs` for instance:

##strands/programming.ejs

~~~

    The IoT requires a new breed of software skills, with an emphasis on flexible, reactive, and highly networked applications and services. This software runs on a diverse range of systems, is frequently connected to cloudservices, and may be capable of leveraging large data sets to deliver inferences and decision support in an informedmanner. The software is designed and implemented using agile techniques, with an emphasis on test driven developmentand quality user experiences..

  <h2> Programming Learning Path </h2>
  <p>
    The Data Science strand will begin with the fundamentals of relational databases used to store structured transactional business data. This data holds the basisfor reporting and descriptive analysis required to predict future events and to identify relationships in data. In the third year the students will extend their knowledge to NoSQL (especially for managing unstructured data) databases and data warehouses (supporting consistent views of a domain, and as a springboard for statistics and machine learning analyses). In the IoT context the importance of dealing with large volumes of data in terms of storage and analytics is great. The skills they learn will allow them to design and implement the appropriate data solution with a complete understanding and knowledge of the available options. The students will learn about the trade-offs in terms of consistency, availability and partitioning. In the fourth year students will learn and implement the skills of data mining covering classification, prediction and clustering, applied to data that had been managed using methods and technologies they have learned about in previous years.

All we have done is delete content from the top and tail of the page - everything else is left exactly as it was. 

Do this now for all strand pages (but NOT for index.ejs) - and once completed, verify that the pages is 'served' correctly.

Your project will eventually be structured like this:

~~~
