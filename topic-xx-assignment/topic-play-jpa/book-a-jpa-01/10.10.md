#Delete Player Feature

Introduce the following method into the controllers/Players:

~~~java
  public static void delete(Long id)
  {
    Player player = Player.findById(id);
    if (player != null)
    {
      if (player.club != null)
      {
        player.club.removePlayer(player);
        player.club.save();
      }
      player.delete();
    }
    index();
  }
~~~

Which requires this method in models/Club.java

~~~java
  public void removePlayer(Player player)
  {
    players.remove(player);
  }
~~~

Now change the loop in the 'views/Players/index.html' file:

~~~html
      #{list items:players, as:'player'}
        <tr>
          <td>${player.name}</td>
          <td>${player.club.name}</td>
          <td> <a href="/players/delete/${player.id}">Delete</a> </td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      #{/list}
~~~

(just one line changed in the above).

Run the app - players now have a delete button, when you press it, you get an error. This is because we need to establish a route for the delete link. Introduce this in to conf/routes now:

~~~
GET    /players/delete/{id}                     Players.delete
~~~

And try again. You should be able to delete players.
