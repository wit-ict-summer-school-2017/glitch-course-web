#Routes + Test Data 

Before we can start the app in normal mode, we will need to make sure this line is uncommented in the `application.conf` file:

~~~
db.default=mem
~~~

Now incorporate the following routes:

~~~
# Home page
GET     /                                       Divisions.index
GET     /divisions                              Divisions.index
GET     /clubs                                  Clubs.index
GET     /players                                Players.index
GET     /sponsors                               Sponsors.index
~~~

Save everything and run (not in test mode). Browse to

- <http://localhost:9000/players>
- <http://localhost:9000/clubs>
- <http://localhost:9000/sponsors>
- <http://localhost:9000/divisions>

It views will be largely bank and unformatted. 

Create a class called 'BootStrap.java' in you 'app' folder, and replace its content with this source here:

##BootStrap.java

~~~java
import java.util.List;

import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;
import models.*;
 
@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job 
{ 
  public void doJob()
  {
    Fixtures.deleteDatabase(); 
    Fixtures.loadModels("data.yml");
  }
}
~~~

Run the app again, and you should start to see some data.
