##Exercise 1

On the clubs page, have the table display the sponsors.

##Exercise 2

Following on from step 7, provide buttons/views to create Clubs, Divisions and Sponsors. You may need to use the `null safe` operator from step 7 to do this effectively.

##Exercise 3

We still dont have a way of enabling the user to establish associations between the different models. E.g. have new player belong to a club, or clubs be in a division etc..

How would you approach this?
