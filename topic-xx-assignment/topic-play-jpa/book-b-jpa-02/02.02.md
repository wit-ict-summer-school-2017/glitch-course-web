#Delete Club

First introduce the delete button in the clubs view:

~~~html
          <td> 
            <a class="ui ui icon button" href="/clubs/delete/${club.id}">
             <i class="delete red icon"></i>
            </a> 
          </td>
~~~

We need a supporting route:

~~~
GET    /clubs/delete/{id}                       Clubs.delete
~~~

... and this method in the Clubs controller:

~~~java
  public static void delete(Long id)
  {
    Club club = Club.findById(id);
    if (club != null)
    {
      Logger.info("Trying to delete " + club.name);
      List<Division> divisions = Division.findAll();
      for (Division division : divisions)
      {
        if (division.members.contains(club))
        {
          division.members.remove(club);
          division.save();
          Logger.info ("removing club from division");
        }
      }
      club.delete();
    }
    index();
  } 
~~~

Try deleting clubs now.
