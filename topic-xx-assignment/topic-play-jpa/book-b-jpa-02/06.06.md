#New Player

We would like a way of adding a new player via the UI.

First, bring in a new button on the player view to trigger the creating of a player:

~~~html
  <a class="ui blue button" href="/players/addplayer">
    <i class="user icon"></i> Add Player
  </a> 
~~~

Then the routes:

~~~
GET    /players/addplayer                       Players.addPlayer
POST   /players/newplayer                       Players.newPlayer
~~~

..and the method in Players to display the add player form:

~~~java
  public static void addPlayer()
  {
    render();
  }

  public static void newPlayer(String name)
  {
    Player player = new Player (name);
    player.save();
    index();
  }
~~~

We also need a form

##views/Players/addplayer.html

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Player Details' /}

<section class="ui raised form segment">
  <form action="/players/newplayer" method="POST">
    <div class="field">
      <label> Player Name </label>
      <input type="text" name="name">
    </div>  
    <button class="ui blue submit button">Add</button>
  </form>
</section>
~~~

Try this out now. 

You will get an error - as you have added a player, however not associated the player with a club. The club is a 'null' reference in the database, and causes the view to fail.

We can fix this easily, permitting 'unattached' players. Open `views/Players/index.html` and replace this line:

~~~html
<td>  ${player.club.name} </td>
~~~

with this:

~~~html
<td>  ${player.club?.name} </td>
~~~

There is a very small difference. This is using a `null-safe` operator `?` when trying to access the clubs name. If the club is null (i.e. there is no club), we will not attempt to reach into the name field.

Make sure this works now as expected.
