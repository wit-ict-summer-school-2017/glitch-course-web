# Controller/View/Route

Bringing in a new controller usually requires three things:

- a controller
- a view
- a route

Here is is the new controller:

## controllers/playlist.js

~~~js
'use strict';

const logger = require('../utils/logger');
const playlistCollection = require('../models/playlist-store.js');

const playlist = {
  index(request, response) {
    const viewData = {
      title: 'Playlist',
    };
    response.render('playlist', viewData);
  },
};

module.exports = playlist;
~~~

This will render a view called `playlist`. This is the playlist view (for the moment):

## views/playlist.hbs

~~~html
{{> menu}}

<section class="ui center aligned middle aligned segment">
  <h2 class="ui header">
    Playlist Details...
  </h2>
</section>
~~~

Finally, the route. This will require the controller to be imported:

## routes.js

~~~js
...
const playlist = require('./controllers/playlist.js');
...
~~~

... and then we can add the new route:

~~~js
router.get('/playlist/:id', playlist.index);
~~~

Notice that the route includes this segment: `/:id`. This means it matches any route that includes an extra wildcard segment at the end.

Implement all of the above now and verify that the view is rendered as expected.
