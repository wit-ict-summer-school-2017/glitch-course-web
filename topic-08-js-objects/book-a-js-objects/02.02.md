# Object Basics II

### Keys Are Always Strings in JavaScript

It is important to note that the type of a key in JavaScript is always a string. Let's say we create the following object of some employee id to the employee name:

~~~
var idToName = {
    754: "Tim",
    843: "Matt",
    921: "Janey",
    192: "Elie"
};

~~~

Now we want to access the key `754` to get the value `"Tim"`. We cannot use the dot notation for this:

~~~
idToName.754;  // causes an error
~~~

Instead we need to use the bracket notation. And the value inside the bracket notation is a string:

~~~
idToName["754"];  // returns "Tim"
~~~

So even though we did not quote the key name when we created the `idToName` object, JavaScript automatically converts the number into a string. **Every key in a JavaScript object is a string!**

#### Adding to objects

To add properties or functions (which are sometimes called methods) to our objects, we can use the `.` or `[]` operator (as before, the dot notation is preferred, but not always possible).

~~~
var obj = {
  name: "Jon Snow",
  watchMember: true,
};

obj.gameOfThrones = "awesome";
obj;

/*
{
    name: "Jon Snow",
    watchMember: true,
    gameOfThrones: "awesome"
}
*/
~~~

#### Removing from objects

We can remove a key from an object by using the `delete` keywork. Here's an example:

~~~
var obj = {
  name: "Elie",
  job: "Instructor"
};

delete obj.job; // returns true

obj;

/*
{
    name: "Elie"
}
*/
~~~

##Exercises 3: Dot and Bracket notation.

- Access each value from your goMark object using both dot notation and brakcet notation.
- Add a key for 'category' to your object. Remove the key and value for 'rating'.
