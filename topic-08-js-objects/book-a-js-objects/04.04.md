# Object Iteration II

#### if...in: Determining If a Key Exists in an Object

Sometimes, we just want to check and see if a certain key exists in an object. To do that we use a `if...in` statement. Here is an example

~~~
var obj = {
    favoriteNumber: 33,
    favoriteColor: 'blue'
}

if ("favoriteNumber" in obj){
    console.log("The favoriteNumber key exists!");
}

// "The favoriteNumber key exists!"

if ("nothing" in obj){
    console.log("The nothing key exists!");
}
~~~

### Exercises

Use the files you created earlier:

- objects-09.html
- objects-09.js

## Exercise 4

Experiment with the following:

- Given the following object below, write code to print the value then the key to the console separated by `=>`

~~~
const goMark = {
  url: "http://www.wit.ie",
  description: "third level educational institution",
  rating: 3,
};
~~~

~~~
// Output should be:
// http://www.wit.ie => url
// third level educational institution => description
// 3 => rating
~~~


- Add a key of your name and a value for your the year you started in W.I.T.
- Write an if statement that console.logs your name and the year you started in W.I.T to the console if the key of your name is contained in the object.
